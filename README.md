# Eng4_Sky_Pi

## Proposal

For this years PI in the sky project we will make a drone that flys and pie's you in the face. (insert inmage of clown pieing someone in the face) because we arent able to make a drone that has the lift power for a whole pie we have three diffrent alternatives.  The Co2 piecanon, a trapdoor, and a spring loaded launcher.   the launching mechagnism is the most interesting part of this project, but certainly not the most complicated or the most important, so we plan on designing the drone before anything else.  most of the information about drones that we are learning comes from this really exellent two part youtube series on drone theory by riley morgan (linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05UwsiqZ_E&list=PLwQuIH2CxvuNwSc9hrZjqlJOshi5iXb3l)
