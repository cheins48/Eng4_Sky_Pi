# Proposal

For this years PI in the sky project me and dylan decided to make a thomas the tie fighter drone.  we think it would be a poetic end to our in class independent projects, as our first project together was thomas the dank tank.  we were inspired by this offhand photo we found.

## Problem
I do not have a thomas the tie fighter drone. This is a huge issue. Plus, Our first project (thomas the dank tank), was cut off at the last minute so we would like to let the Dank tank go out in a bang.

## Solution
make a thomas the tie fighter drone that shoots lasers and scares children.

## Some forseeable bumps in the road include:
1. the shape of tie fighters are really strange.  the walls and the shape of the cockpit will introduce a interesting challenge of space (get it, like space wars) managment.
2. weight,  goes hand in hand w/ the previous issue of shape.  but the walls will introduce a lot more weght to the build, the choice of material will be very important.  it will probably be styrofoam.
3. drone parts (see shopping list at bottom of page).  apparently we have a lot of these in the lab from an old Eng4 project but me and dylan havent seen any of them.
4. learning to program the drone parts.  the most annoying part of this is that there are countless drone coding tutorials ive found, but most are useless until I know what kind of harware I'm working with.
5. figuring out what out PI is gonna do.  the current plan is to make it turn laser pointers on and make a "pew" sound.

### Sudo Code For Laser
 ``` python
import pygame

# When turned on speaker plays downloaded audio

pygame.mixer.init()
pygame.mixer.music.load("myFile.wav")
pygame.mixer.music.play()
while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy() == True:
    continue
    
# When button on controller is pressed, laser go pew pew.
# When button is pressed, signal reaches laser's power sourse and turns on

```

most of the information about drones that we are learning comes from this really exellent two part youtube series on drone theory by riley morgan (linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05UwsiqZ_E&list=PLwQuIH2CxvuNwSc9hrZjqlJOshi5iXb3l)

## Schedule

We will only plan two to three weeks at a time to maintain flexablity.

our first three weeks will be dedicated to getting the PI stuff outta the way. 
feb 21st to 26th getting the lazer code opperational
feb 28th to march 2nd getting the speaker working
march 4th to 9th *Might* be dedicated to getting a signal from a remote and controling it remotly with a controller depending on whether we have a micro reciever, and if we are able to get the other weeks done.

# Project Pivot

## Problems

- Due to some unpredicted issues, we have changed our project backed to the whipped cream launching drone. We already have the rough drafts and the cost of our project will be reduced. The drone would have an attachment that could drop whipped cream on people. (Mr.Miller)

## Rough draft

## Risks

- We altered our project a little late in the game but we still think that this is the best decision.
- We might have some complications with weight while making the whipped cream launcher.
- whipped cream = mess
